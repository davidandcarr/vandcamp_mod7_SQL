##Analysis of Data from Pewlett Hackard

In this week's installment the client has asked for a breakdown of the retiring employee-base, as well as some insights into employees that may benefit from a mentorship (ideally to fill the holes left by retirees.) Let's take a look.

##Retirees
Pewlett, while having a degree of purport, is certainly an aging company. As of today, just over a fifth of the entire employee base is eligible for retirement. That's 67,366 employees, nearly half of which that hold senior positions.

As shown above, the greatest number of retirement-age employees lies within the Engineering and general staff departments. Seeing as these roles are often more entry-level and can pose some high turnover, that is not particularly concerning. However, it is clear that leadership positions will have a massive rollover in not too long of a time.

##Mentees
On the contrast, there are just under 2000 employees eligible for an in-house mentorship, about a third of which are general staff.

While the mentor-eligible cross section is dwarfed by the retirement-eligible count, there lies great promise within these numbers to self-recoup the loss of employees to retirement. Besides, if the company were to capitalize on this pool of mentees, a new position at the company may keep those employees at bay from their own employment for longer into the future. 

##Conclusion
First and foremost, Pewlett should engage some aggressive scouting and onboarding, seeing as the retirement pool far outweighs the pool of mentees. That said, the large eligibility pool for mentorship should be invested in immediately. Certainly not all will jump at the opportunity, but maintaining a current hire and tracking them into upward mobility is much less expensive than scouting. Similarly, the time for onboarding and orientation cuts into productivity time for any replacement hires necessary.
